A topological sort involves arranging a DAG (directed, acyclic graph) in such a manner such that for every node $m$ with an incoming edge $E$ from a node $n$, $n$ occurs before $m$.
This can easily be visualized by thinking of $m$ being a target in a makefile with $n$ as a dependency or $n$ being some prerequisite for $m$.
Topological sorts typically run in linear ($O(V + E)$) time.
